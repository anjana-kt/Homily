# _Homily_
Application to market home business.

## Inspiration
We have witnessed our friends and relatives struggle to find a suitable market and finding it hard to advertise their products to help them reach out to a larger audience.
<p>Also we noticed that big  businesses have many great strategies to do business analysis through professionals as well as advanced and expensive software which help them grow better. So we felt to do something for home business to reduce this gap.</p>


## What it does ?
<p>It’s a virtual platform where the people who can’t afford a shop can create a virtual store, sell and advertise their homemade products, also acquire business intelligence.</p>
<p>Through this virtual store feature people doing home businesses especially women can market their products by adding pictures and videos of  their team, how they make the product, the packaging and many more so that the customers can see more than the surface. Also they can market by using the advertising feature where we provide  location and interest based ads. The customers who follow the shop through this app gets notified if a new special/innovative products are added by the vendor. The users are provided with display, payment and delivery options. </p>
<p>And the most interesting part is that the home business people get business intelligence so that they can know the latest trends, demands and they get an analysis of their growth rate and reviews.</p>

## How we built it...
Through constant hard work and determination of our team members, we built it using flutter with firebase as backend and developed a better user interface using Figma, also we referred to one of our  friends who is a business analyst for the business intelligence.

## Challenges we ran into
<p>Being a team of just three members and beginners we had to face a lot of issues due to lack of app development skills. We faced network issues and were not being able to communicate often as we were from different regions. </p>
<p>We did overcome these challenges by developing our skills to the next level within a short period of time through strong determination and hard work even if it was just the three of us.</p>

## What's next for _Homily_??
<p>Adding artificial intelligence to  help people get ideas with more accuracy to help them take bold decisions confidently.</p>
<p>We also want to include features where we could provide them with necessary tools and templates for making customizable ads.</p>
